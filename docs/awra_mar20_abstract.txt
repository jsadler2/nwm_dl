Title:
Who needs humans when you have computers?

Text: 
Traditionally, the development of a computational hydrodrologic model begins with a human (or group of humans) translates understanding physical processes into a mathematical and then computational model. The machine learning (ML) approach is different. Machine-learning models do not rely on limited human knowledge and understanding to derive complex relationships between driver input data and output data. Thus, ML abstracts from the scientist the complexity of developing the mathematical models and implementation of those models in computer code. This abstraction can be justifiable when the limit of human understanding, humans' ability to describe that understanding mathematically, and humans' ability to translate mathematical models into computational models is acknowledged. When machine learning algorithms derive a computational relationship between input and output data. In some ways this can be thought of as an extension of the calibration procedure that is performed in nearly every modelling excercise. However, instead of adjusting certain parameters, ML algorithms have the flexibility to adjust all parameters in a model. One of the challenges that ML faces is the lack of physical constraints which could render the model physically unrealistic (though physics-based models may face the same challenge if calibrated parameters exceed or are completely unrelated to physically meaningful characteristics). That said, one of the emerging research trends is to incorporate physical meaning and/or enforce physical contraints on ML models to maintain a tie to the physical world where a non-trival amount of knowledge has been won by scientist up until this point. One example of this is penalizing the ML model for breaking a law of conservation.
